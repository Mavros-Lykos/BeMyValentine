NOTICES:

This project was inspired by the viral "Will you be my Valentine?" interactive
website concept that spread across social media. The original idea of a playful,
dodging "No" button is a beloved internet tradition. This implementation is an
original creative work by Mavros Lykos, building upon that concept with a full
animated story experience.
