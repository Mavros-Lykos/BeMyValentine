## ✨ Features

- **Personalized Proposals** — Enter names, pick a gender, and write a custom message
- **Animated Story Flow** — Multi-step journey with greeting, build-up screens, and a WhatsApp-style chat sequence
- **The Big Question** — "Will you be my Valentine?" with Yes/No buttons
- **Playful "No" Button** — Dodges clicks, shrinks, and shows pleading GIFs that grow in size
- **Celebration Screen** — Confetti, dancing GIF animations from the corners, and share options

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Create** — Fill in your name, recipient's name, gender, and a custom message
2. **Share** — Send the generated link via WhatsApp, Telegram, or copy it
3. **Experience** — Your valentine opens the link and goes through the animated story
4. **Answer** — They click Yes (or try to click No 😏) and celebrate!

## 💡 Credits & Inspiration

This project was inspired by the viral "Will you be my Valentine?" interactive websites that spread across social media. The concept of a playful, dodging "No" button and escalating pleas is a beloved internet tradition, reimagined here with a full story experience.
